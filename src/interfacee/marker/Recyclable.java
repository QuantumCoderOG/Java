//In Java, a Marker Interface is an interface that does not contain any methods or
// fields and is used to mark or tag a class to provide some special behavior or functionality.
// The main purpose of a marker interface is to signal to the JVM or other code (like frameworks, libraries,
// or compilers)
// that the class implementing this interface should be treated differently.
